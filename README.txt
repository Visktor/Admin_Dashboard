This project's objective was mainly putting in practice my recently accquired css grid
skills, which I believe was achieved. Most of the content as of the moment is boilerplate,
but I do intend to change most of it in the future while retaining the original idea.
Right now, I believe my uttermost goal should be practicing the tools and technologies
I need to get to my first job. Therefore, I will leave it as it is, in the hopes
I'll have the time to build it into my original vision for it when the time is right.
